# Differences Between SOA and Microservices

  - __Granularity__: Microservices are typically smaller and more focused than SOA services. Microservices are designed to be as small as possible, with each service responsible for a specific task or function. In contrast, SOA services tend to be larger and more complex, with each service responsible for a broader set of functions.
  
  - __Communication__: Microservices communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as REST and JSON. They are designed to be loosely coupled, with each service communicating only with the services it needs to. SOA services, on the other hand, communicate using more heavyweight protocols such as SOAP and XML. They are designed to be more tightly coupled, with each service communicating with a central service bus.

  - __Deployment__: Microservices are typically deployed independently of each other, with each service running in its own container or virtual machine. This makes it easier to scale individual services and deploy updates without affecting the rest of the system. SOA services, on the other hand, are often deployed together as part of a larger application or middleware platform.

  - __Agility__: Microservices are designed to be agile and flexible, with the ability to evolve and change over time. They are often associated with DevOps practices and continuous delivery, which allow for rapid iteration and deployment. SOA services, on the other hand, are often associated with more traditional software development practices, which may be slower and more rigid.

  - __Ownership__: In a microservices architecture, each service is typically owned and managed by a small team of developers. This promotes ownership and accountability, and allows for faster decision-making and deployment. In a SOA architecture, services may be owned and managed by different teams or departments, which can lead to coordination and communication challenges.
