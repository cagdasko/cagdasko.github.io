# Database Sharding

Database sharding is a technique used to horizontally partition large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is a subset of the full database, and contains a subset of the data stored in the database.

The goal of database sharding is to improve the performance and scalability of large databases by distributing the data across multiple servers. This allows the database to handle more concurrent users and larger amounts of data without becoming overloaded.

In a sharded database, data is typically partitioned based on a key value, such as a customer ID or a date range. Each shard is then assigned to a separate database server, which is responsible for storing and retrieving the data within that shard.

When a user performs a query or transaction that involves data stored across multiple shards, the query is executed across all the relevant shards in parallel, and the results are combined by the application server.

Database sharding is commonly used in applications with high levels of concurrent user traffic, such as social networking sites, online marketplaces, and e-commerce platforms. By distributing the database load across multiple servers, database sharding can help to improve performance, reduce latency, and provide a better user experience.
